# angelMatch
# Overview


This webapp was created to try and have a dating site that will match the user with other people that hate the same foods. In order to run the server, you need to download the github repository. Once downloaded make sure you are inside the hateApp folder and run the "py manage.py runserver" command in the terminal. That will run the webpage. 

The purpose for writing the webpage was to learn how Django works and how to incorperate a database with it.

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}
I have three webpages in this application. 
The first one will show you the database and allow you see everyones name, age and food that they dislike.
Second webpage will send you to an updated page where you can update the database through django. In order to get there, you must click on the number on the left which is their number in the list of people. 
The third page is a page where you can add a new member. You simply click on the add member button and it will direct you to that page. 
Lastly there is the dating page which will show you who you matched with based on the database provided. 

# Development Environment
