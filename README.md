# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}
This webapp was created to try and have a dating site that will match the user with other people that hate the same foods. In order to run the server, you need to download
the github repository. Once downloaded make sure you are inside the hateApp folder and run the "py manage.py runserver" command in the terminal. That will run the 
webpage. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
The purpose for writing the webpage was to learn how Django works and how to incorperate a database with it. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
